# Optimizely AI Revenue Intelligence Platform - Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview

### Vision Statement
Build an AI-powered revenue intelligence platform that transforms website visitors into qualified leads for B2B companies by predicting purchase intent in real-time and automatically personalizing the experience to maximize conversion rates by 40%+.

---
### Universal, API-First, Platform-Agnostic Architecture
**Core Principle:** The platform is designed as a universal, API-first, and platform-agnostic system. All core intelligence, optimization, and data processing logic is exposed via APIs that do not assume any specific frontend or backend technology stack.

- **API endpoints** must be decoupled from any particular frontend or backend implementation.
- **Data models** must be flexible and extensible to support a wide range of integration scenarios and future requirements.
- **Authentication** must support multi-tenancy and secure, scalable integrations.
- **SDKs/adapters** for popular platforms (e.g., React, Next.js, WordPress, Shopify, etc.) are planned, but not required for the MVP.
- **Documentation and onboarding** must be prioritized to enable third-party developers to easily integrate and extend the platform.

All technical and product decisions must align with this universal, API-first vision to ensure long-term adaptability and ease of integration across diverse web platforms.

---

### Business Context
- **Target Market**: B2B companies with 6+ figure deals (SaaS, Professional Services, Manufacturing, Consulting)
- **Problem**: Only 2-4% of B2B website visitors convert to qualified leads
- **Solution**: AI system that scores visitors 0-100 and automatically triggers personalized experiences
- **Goal**: Increase lead conversion rates to 8-15% through intelligent personalization
- **Revenue Impact**: $500K-5M+ annual pipeline value per client

### Market Opportunity
- **Addressable Market**: 50M+ B2B websites globally
- **Average Deal Size**: $25K-500K per client annually
- **Competitive Advantage**: First-to-market AI revenue prediction for anonymous visitors
- **Growth Vector**: High recurring revenue with proven ROI metrics
